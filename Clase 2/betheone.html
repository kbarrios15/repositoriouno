<h2>Letra</h2>
<p>I see the Moon, I see the Moon, I see the Moon
    Oh, when you're looking at the Sun
    I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
    No, you're not fooling anyone</p>
    <p>Oh, but when you're gone
        When you're gone, when you're gone
        Oh baby, all the lights go out
        Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
        I was wrong, I was wrong
        Come back to me, baby, we can work this out</p>
    <p>Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
        Just another chance so that I can show
        That I won't let you down and run
        No, I won't let you down and run
        'Cause I could be the one
        I could be the one
        I could be the one
        I could be the one</p>
        <p>I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
            Oh, when you see everything in red
            There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
            Do for you, do for you
            Oh, 'cause you got inside my head</p>
            <p>Oh, but when you're gone
                When you're gone, when you're gone
                Oh baby, all the lights go out
                Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
                I was wrong, I was wrong
                Come back to me, baby, we can work this out</p>
